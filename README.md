## Post-mortems

As you move your application to production, you will run into problems no matter how great your team is. Make sure you never make the same mistake twice. For this reason, _write_ post-mortems that everyone (across teams) reads, so the company as a whole can learn from it.

## Training

#### Official

#### Unofficial

Trainings days, afternoons or even an hour a week can help.
Have someone new teach each time. Imparting knowledge to others solidifes it in your own mind.
Each session must have ideas (laughably vague is fine) for how this knowledge can be applied in the "real" world.
